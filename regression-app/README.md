# From Notebook to API A Production-Grade ML Regression System

## Project Summary
Build an end-to-end regression pipeline that: 
1. Loads and processes the California Housing Price Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price) 
2. Trains and tunes 2 regression models: RandomForest and XGBoost
3. Logs metrics and artifacts with MLflow
4. Packages the training + inference logic into a reusable Python module 
5. Exposes a prediction API via FastAPI
6. Dockerizes the entire project 
7. Deploys the service locally
